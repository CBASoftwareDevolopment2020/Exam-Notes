# Test

## Exam Questions

1.  We have looked at some _static analysis tools_ like StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs and SonarLint. Explain how static analysis can improve code quality. Explain how it helped you or could have helped you in your project.
    - StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs
    - Linters, SonarLint
    - Security
2.  Explain test levels, and what characterizes the individual levels. Then, relate to your own project.
    - unit testing
    - integration testing
    - system testing
    - load testing
    - static testing
    - Acceptance testing
3.  Explain what kinds of test can be carried out without running any code. Explain how it can be used on non-code documents as well.
    - Reviews
    - Technical reviews
    - Management reviews
    - Audit
    - Static analysis
    - Linters
4.  Explain test activities, and how they are related to each other. Then explain the test activities you carried out in your project.
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - Refactoring
    - Maintenance
    - Continuous Integration
    - Code reviews
5.  Testing is related to ensuring higher code quality. Elaborate on what characterizes high code quality, and what makes code testable.
    - Testable code
    - Names of tests
    - “sufficient” tests of a method or class
    - Assertions, defensive programming
    - Dependency injection
6.  Explain the concept of maintainable code, and how it’s related to test. Explain how to find out if a code base is maintainable.
    - Maintainability
    - Product quality
    - Temporal coupling
    - Continuous Integration
    - Static Analysis
    - Dependency injection, inversion of control
    - Low coupling, high cohesion
    - Cyclomatic code complexity
7.  Explain unit testing, and what characterizes it in contrast to other types of test.
    - What and why
    - Unit Under Test _ System Under Test_
    - Unit test lifecycle(BeforeAll, AfterAll _ SetUp, TearDown)_
    - Test doubles (mock, fake, stub, spy)
    - Matchers(Hamcrest)
    - Test Driven Development
    - Dependency Injection
    - Equivalence classes, boundary value analysis, equivalence partitions
8.  Explain test driven development, and how it affects the development process and code quality.
    - Red, Green, Refactor
    - Testable code
    - Maintainable code
    - Equivalence partitions
    - Positive, negative tests
9.  Explain about test doubles. Explain how and why mocking is useful, and in what test areas.
    - JMock, mocks, spies, stubs, fakes, dummies
    - Dependency injection
    - Interfaces, contracts
    - Black-box vs white-box
10. Characterize high quality software. Explain how writing tests can increase code quality.
    - Defensive programming
    - Black-box development
    - Interfaces, contracts
    - Inversion of control
    - dependency injection
    - Components
11. Elaborate on dependencies in software, and how it’s related to the subject of test.
    - Dependencies between layers
    - System resources
    - Relations between objects
    - Dependency inversion, Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection
    - Mocks
12. Explain problems in test automation, and how a continuous integration tool can help.
    - What is Continuous Integration?
    - How can a CI help regarding tests?
    - What is a regression?
    - What test levels can be covered by a CI system?
13. Explain specification-based testing, and how you can be more confident that you have written a sufficient amount of tests.
    - Equivalence partitioning
    - Boundary value analysis
    - Edge cases
    - Decision tables
    - Code coverage
